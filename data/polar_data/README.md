**TODO: verify below information**

The file naming convention is `NAME_AZIMUTH_ELEVATION`, where
- `NAME` is either `Mes` or `Mes_b`. For Mes, the mic was used without PCB, for `Mes_b` it was mounted on a PCB.  
- `AZIMUTH` is the angle of the source in the x-y plane. 
- `ELEVATION` is the angle of the source perpendicular to x-y plane, and the 0-direction is "below" the microphone.
