Write one wire memory:

git clone https://github.com/bitcraze/crazyflie2-nrf-firmware

cd crazyflie2-nrf-firmware

make BLE=0

make BLE=0 cload

- Modify the write-ow.py example to fit your data, run it
- You can read back the memory with the read-ow.py example
- If you want bluetooth back you can compile again the nrf firmware (make clean all) or flash the latest released firmware package.
